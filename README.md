This is the introductory data science processing project for Spring 2024. The goal of this project is to introduce members to a variety of data science tools and processes. We hope you will understand how to clean, process, and model data after this project! 

We are covering a variety of tools across 4 weeks:
1. Excel, Tableau, and Power BI
2. R
3. Python
4. Deliverables (Putting it together)

This GitHub serves as a central location to store tutorials, files, and other materials related to this project. With any questions/concerns feel free to reach me at ayank@smu.edu or 972-904-8585.
